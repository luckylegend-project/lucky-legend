## 🔥 Token Burn Transparency

Lucky Legend has implemented token burns using the Sol Incinerator tool on Solana.

Due to the nature of Sol Incinerator burns, multiple burn transactions may originate from different temporary wallets.

Burns are executed for transparency and long-term supply integrity.
